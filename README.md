# readme
You can call me Asher, I'm a CE student currently but I'm also trying to gain more professional experience.
My main interest is back-end development so I'm trying to better my underestanding and experience at technologies most used with back-end development(such as docker, redis, celery, swagger and so on and so forth).

Initially, after learning python, the first steps I took for a career started in machine learning and I'm somewhat familiar with it( I can and know how to use pandas, matplotlib and numpy). Later I decided to further use this information alongside django development.
In order to underestand websites better through inspecting them, I tried to learn a useful amount of information about front-end(HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ...). But by no means am I a professional at underestanding front-end development.


I am familiar with SQL databases and using queries, and currently I'm getting more familiar with networking but I'm still learning more about the internet.
I happen to be familiar with linux as well, but again there is much to be learned about it too.


Any help, comment and criticism is appreciated <3
